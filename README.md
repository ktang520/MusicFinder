# Analysis
This app can give you songs and artists from spotify. Although I would like to make it more seamless because right now it is using a pre made prompt and I want it to be like chatGPT where it can take a variety of different prompts from users and give the best answer. There are definite limitations when asking about specific things regarding genres, artists, and songs. An example could be if I wanted to generate an artist with a certain number of monthly listeners but is similar to a popular artist. 

# Improvements
Improvements for the future could be making it more seamless. I would like to change it so it can generate a specific answer for the user. I also am going to change the layout because this one is just pre generated from a library. I would like to make it spotify colors and more sleek. Once everything looks good I would then like to deploy it on somehing like a cloud but that's after everything is looking good.
